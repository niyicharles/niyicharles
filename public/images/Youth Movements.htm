<h2 align="center">Youth Movements</h2>
<hr>


<p align="JUSTIFY">
 In Israel today, as in many other countries  throughout
the Jewish world, youth movements are an extensive, organized phenomenon. Most Jewish youth
movements were established in Eastern Europe towards the beginning of the
twentieth century, motivated by the desire for the national revival of the
Jewish people in their homeland. Like other European youth movements, they
were critical of established society and idealized a return to nature and a
simpler - rural - way of life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Youth movements provide an opportunity for teenagers to put their feelings
and ideals into action; to make an impact on the world around them, by
helping others and by building their land; and, not least in importance, to
form connections with other young persons around the globe whose ideals
match or complement their own. Members of Zionist youth movements, more than
most, try to meet these challenges. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">During and shortly after World War I, the social climate in the streets and
  schools of many European countries became extremely nationalistic and
  anti-Semitic. The German youth movements took a nationalist turn, and most
  barred Jews. The Jews of Eastern Europe were engulfed in a sense of crisis
  after the war, heightened by the pogroms which erupted at this time, and
  this fostered the Zionist national consciousness of Jewish youth.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Among the first Zionist youth movements was Blau-Weiss (Blue-White), established in
Germany in 1912 before World War I. The Jewish youth movement with the largest
membership and most significant impact, though, was Hashomer Hatza'ir, which promoted Socialist-Zionistideology.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Youth movements played an important role in the history of Jewry between the
two world wars. Their influence greatly exceeded their numerical importance
in community organization, education, political awareness and Zionist
consciousness. Practically speaking, they were also the builders of the
kibbutz movement. Their special inner strength became apparent, tragically,
during the Holocaust. They remained active throughout this catastrophe, and
their leaders orchestrated Jewish organization and resistance in ghettoes
and camps. They also helped plan and implement the Beriha (escape from
Europe) movement after the Holocaust. Most of the surviving members
eventually settled in Palestine. The destruction of the Jewish communities
of central and eastern Europe also marked the end of the Jewish youth
movements there.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Most of the youth movements that originated in Eastern Europe established
worldwide organizations but these had much less impact. The main movements
founded in Eastern Europe have branches in the United States, but young
people there tend to join social organizations that are less emphatically
political. American Jewish teenagers, thus, mostly belong not to zionist
youth movements but to organizations such as B'nai B'rith, associations of
synagogues, or local and countrywide community organizations which also
impart Jewish-Zionist consciousness.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Youth movements in the Diaspora today play a large part in raising Jewish
consciousness among youth. Activities focus on Jewish subjects and encourage
members to congregate at Jewish institutions such as synagogues; ties with
other young Jews are thus strengthened. Most youth movements encourage their
members to spend time in Israel, and some have programs in Israel, ranging
in length from a few weeks to a year, for their members. Many new immigrants
to Israel from the free world have been influenced by youth movements in
their countries of origin.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Youth movements in Palestine began to organize in the 1920s, chiefly under
the influence of movement alumni who had come from the Diaspora. They
stressed togetherness, pioneering and personal fulfillment, especially on
the kibbutz. Here, as in Europe, their public impact and influence on young
people was immense.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Most of the movements were affiliated with political entities or even
established them. Only the Scouts movement defined itself as nonpartisan,
but it also educated its members in a national pioneering spirit and
established agricultural training groups that founded their own
kibbutzim.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


The establishment of the State of Israel marked the fulfillment of many of
the goals toward which the movements had educated, and state institutions
now took over national tasks such as education. Over the past two decades,
the social scale of values of Israeli society has changed, and to some
extent, the competitive and materialistic climate has crowded out the
pioneering ideals and romanticism of the youth movements. They have,
however, continued to cope with social change and are attempting to adjust
to changing goals.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">BETAR</font></strong> (Heb. acronym for <em>Brit Yosef Trumpeldor- The Covenant of Joseph Trumpeldor</em>),
the educational youth movement of the Revisionist Zionist Organization and,
subsequently, the Herut movement, was established in December 1923 in Riga,
Latvia. The ideology of Betar included the establishment of a Jewish state
in all of the territory of Mandatory Palestine, ingathering of the exiles,
Zionism without a socialist component, a just society, military training for
self-defense and a pioneering spirit.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


The first members of Betar who settled in Palestine established a kvutsa
(forerunner of the kibbutz) called Menora in Petah Tikva, and were active in
settlement enterprises around the country. Betar spread to other countries,
and established a world organization with Ze'ev Jabotinsky as its head
(1931). The movement solidified and expanded its membership vigorously in
the 1930s, playing an influential role in organizing clandestine immigration
in the years before World War II.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


It is active today in Israel and in the Diaspora, with a membership of
14,500 in Israel and 8,500 around the world.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">BLAU-WEISS</font></strong> (Ger. <em>Blue-White</em>), the first Jewish youth movement established in
Germany (1912) after German youth movements refused to accept Jewish
members. Its nucleus was comprised of Jewish youngsters who were inspired by
the German youth movement culture of outings, hikes and togetherness.
Blau-Weiss adopted an official Zionist platform at its convention in 1922,
stressing emigration to Palestine, retraining for agricultural and manual
labor and rural settlement. The movement members who went to Palestine
joined kibbutzim. Blau-Weiss was disbanded in 1929.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


<strong><font color="Maroon">BNEI AKIVA</font></strong> (Heb. <em>Children of Akiva</em>), a religious Zionist youth movement, was founded in Jerusalem in
1929 with a philosophy of Torah Ve'avoda - a fusion of Orthodox observance
of religious commandments and Zionist pioneering. In 1947 the movement's
first kibbutz, Sa'ad, was founded in the northern Negev. Later on, Bnei
Akiva alumni established kibbutzim and moshavim throughout the country. Kfar
Haro'eh Yeshiva, established in 1940, served as the anchor of a network of
Bnei Akiva yeshivot. The movement is also active in other countries, and its
World Organization was founded in 1954. Today, Bnei Akiva is sponsored by
the National Religious Party (NRP).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


The movement has some 70,000 members in Israel as well as 45,000 in Diaspora
communities around the world.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">DROR</font></strong> (Heb.<em> Liberty</em>), a Socialist Zionist movement founded before World War I in Russia,
promoted national and socialist values as well as Jewish culture. Its
members took part in Jewish self-defense in Russia. After the Bolshevik
revolution, Dror went underground, moved its headquarters to Poland, and, in
1925, joined Poalei Zion. Members who settled in Palestine joined the United
Kibbutz Movement. In 1938, Dror merged with Hehalutz Hatza'ir.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">EZRA</font></strong> (Heb. <em>Help</em>), a religious youth movement named for the biblical prophet Ezra, was
founded in Germany in 1919, while its first groups were founded in Palestine
in 1936. Affiliated at the start with the Orthodox Agudat Israel party, it
now considers itself apolitical. Its aim is to educate young Jews towards
the building of the Land in the spirit of Orthodox Judaism. Its members have
taken part in the establishment of a number of kibbutzim and moshavim, as
well as in various community and educational enterprises. Active today in
Israel and in the Diaspora, the movement has some 7,000 members in Israel
and 3,000 abroad.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="maroon">FEDERATION OF ZIONIST YOUTH (FZY)</font></strong><font color="maroon"><font color="BLACK">, </font></font>British
 Zionist Association founded in 1910. Today, FZY boasts thousands of 
members and sends close to 100 university age students to Israel 
annually to participate on the year long Year Course program (run in 
association with Yound Judaea and the Tzofim). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">GORDONIA</font></strong>, a Zionist pioneering youth movement named for Aaron David
Gordon, a philosopher of Labor Zionism who idealized physical labor,
cooperation, mutual aid and human values. Founded in 1925 in Poland, it
gradually became a worldwide movement. Gordonia became active in Palestine in 1937. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Gordonia joined with the Hapoel
  Hatza'ir youth movement, and in 1945 participated in the establishment of the United
  Kibbutz Movement. By 1951, it had undergone further mergers in Israel and in
  the Diaspora and today it no longer exists. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<strong><font color="Maroon">HABONIM</font></strong> (Heb, <em>The Builders</em>), a Zionist youth movement which aimed to foster Jewish culture, the
Hebrew language, and pioneering in Palestine, was founded in 1930 in London
and affiliated with the Zionist Labor Movement. In the following years it
established additional branches in the United States, South Africa, India,
and Israel.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Habonim union, into which several youth movements in various countries
  were merged, was established in 1958, becoming the largest youth
  organization in the Zionist movement with some 20,000 members. In Israel,
  the Habonim union helped found Hanoar Ha'oved Vehalomed while continuing as
  an active pioneering movement, whose members have established many
  kibbutzim. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="Maroon">HAMAHANOT HA'OLIM</font></b> (Heb. <em>The Immigrant's Camps</em>), a pioneering movement of teenagers in Palestine, stressed
defense and personal fulfillment. It initially evolved from groups in the
Herzliya Gymnasium (high school) in 1926; they established Kvutsat Hahugim
in Hadera in 1929 and eventually settled in Beit Hashita. After this group
merged with breakaway Scouts groups in Haifa and Jerusalem, the Hamahanot
Ha'olim movement was established. It affiliated itself with Hakibbutz
Hame'uhad, and its alumni established kibbutzim. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> It has undergone a number of mergers and splits over the years; today it has
  some 3,000 members. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">HANOAR HA'OVED</font></strong> (Heb. <em>The Working Youth</em>), a movement for working teenagers, was established in 1926 by
the Histadrut (General Federation of Jewish Labor). It aimed to meet the
cultural, social and economic needs of youth while emphasizing the spirit of
pioneering achievement and active participation in a working society. The
movement established night schools and labor bureaus for working youth. Most
of its instructors came from kibbutzim, and the movement established its
first kibbutz, Na'an, in 1933. Its members were founding members of dozens
of additional kibbutzim. Hanoar Ha'oved merged with the Habonim union in
1959, and together they established Hanoar Ha'oved Vehalomed (Working and
Student Youth). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> Over the years, two additional movements for working and studying youth have
  been set up, Hanoar Haleumi Ha'oved Vehalomed and Hanoar Hadati Ha'oved
  Vehalomed. Hanoar Ha'oved Vehalomed today comprises some 80,000 members.</p>
<strong><font color="Maroon">HANOAR HATZIONI</font></strong> (Heb. <em>The Zionist Youth</em>), pioneering Zionist youth movement, was founded in Poland
  in 1932. It supports different types of settlement - kibbutz, moshav and
  development towns - and strives to inculcate its members with a pioneering,
  pluralistic outlook.
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Its members today number some 2,000.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">HAPOEL HATZA'IR </font></strong><font color="black">(Heb. <em>The Young Workers</em>) </font><font color="Maroon"><strong>, </strong></font>founded
 by Zionist pioneer A.D. Gordon in the early twentieth century, Hapoel 
Hatzair is a non-Marxist Labor-Zionist youth movement dedicated to 
instilling its participants with a love of the land of Israel and the 
willingness to work for its agricultural redemption. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">HASHOMER HATZA'IR</font></strong> (Heb. <em>The Young Gaurdsmen</em>), the oldest existing Jewish youth movement in the world,
  defines itself as a world organization of Zionist youth that strives for
  personal pioneering fulfillment in Israel. It developed a singular
  educational ideology and principles that fused scouting, personal example,
  socialist Zionist fulfillment through aliya and a collective lifestyle.
  Founded in Poland (1913-1914), it was a composite of a number of groups that
  merged into a united movement in 1916. The first members of Hashomer
  Hatza'ir came to Palestine with the Third Aliya (1919-1923) and founded
  kibbutzim. In 1927, their kibbutz movement was established in Palestine, and
  a strong relationship took shape between it and the world movement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> In World War II, Hashomer Hatza'ir members continued to operate in the
  Nazi-occupied areas, principally in Poland, and were among the leaders of
  the ghetto uprisings. Mordechai Anielewicz, leader of the Warsaw Ghetto
  uprising, was a member of Hashomer Hatza'ir. After the war, they took part
  in organizing the Beriha movement. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> In 1946, Hashomer Hatza'ir formed a political party which, along with Ahdut
  Ha'avoda, became Mapam in 1948. Hashomer Hatza'ir functions as a youth
  movement in towns, villages and kibbutzim in Israel, as well as in many
  Diaspora communities, with a membership of 14,000 in Israel and 15,000
  abroad. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">HATZOFIM</font></strong> (Heb. <em>Scouts</em>) was founded in Palestine in 1919 in
  accordance with the views of Baden-Powell, the founder of World Scouting. It
  educates towards allegiance to Jewish spiritual values and culture and
  personal fulfillment of Zionist ideals. Scouts alumni volunteered for the
  Haganah (Jewish self-defense organization) and established several
  kibbutzim.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Hatzofim, with 40,000 members in Israel, is affiliated with the World
Organization of Scout Movements.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">HEHALUTZ</font></strong><font color="black"> (Heb. <em>The Pioneer</em>)</font><font color="Maroon">,</font> a worldwide federation of Zionist youth, embraced various
"halutzic" movements, i.e., those that encouraged young people to settle in
Palestine and trained them for labor and rural settlement there. It espoused
the following basic principles: membership in the World Zionist
Organization; fostering of Hebrew language and culture; training for a life
of labor in Palestine; and commitment to personal fulfillment through aliya,
at any time and in any way possible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Pioneering youth associations first came into being in the early twentieth
century. The first countrywide convention of the Hehalutz associations in
Russia, held in Moscow in January 1919, was strongly influenced by the
personality and ideas of Joseph Trumpeldor. Several thousand halutzim
(Zionist pioneers) managed to make their way to Palestine from Russia in
1919-1921, but the movement was repressed and emigration from Russia banned
immediately afterwards.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Between the world wars, Hehalutz associations spread throughout Eastern,
Central, and Western Europe; northern Africa; North and South America; and
South Africa; they were strongest in Poland. Hehalutz reached its peak in
1935, its membership verging on 100,000.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


World War II and the Holocaust devastated the large Jewish centers and
deprived the pioneering movements in Europe of the source of their strength.
Hehalutz maintained its structure in the ghettos as long as it could, and
its members formed the activist core of fighters in ghetto uprisings and the
Jewish partisan units, as well as in the Beriha movement after the
Holocaust.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


Attempts to re-establish a worldwide organization after the war proved
futile. Only in South America is the movement still active.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

<strong><font color="Maroon">MACCABI HATZA'IR</font></strong> (Heb. <em>Young Maccabees</em>) , a pioneering Zionist youth movement, was founded in Germany in
1926 and subsequently expanded to other countries. From 1933 on, this
movement, along with Maccabi Youth, formed the young stratum of the World
Maccabi organization ( an international Jewish sports organization), but it
did not confine itself to sports, engaging also in education for aliya and
rural settlement in Palestine. In 1936, it held its first convention in Tel
Aviv. Members of Maccabi Hatza'ir formed settlement groups, settled in
Palestine, joined settlements and established new ones of their own.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">


The movement has undergone several metamorphoses over the years, and today
has some 3,000 members.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="maroon"><strong>NOAM</strong></font> (Heb. <em>Pleasant</em>), European/Israeli Zionist youth movement affiliated with the Assembly of Masorti (Traditional) Synagogues. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="maroon">NETZER</font></strong><font color="black"> (Heb.<em>New Branch</em>, acronym <em>Noar Tzioni Reformi- Reform Zionist Youth</em>,), Progressive/Reform Zionist youth movement. Netzer was founded in </font>1979
 to educate progressive Zionists about the importance of Israel, 
Judaism, and Jewish values. Today, Netzer has over 12,000 participants 
worldwide and operates in countries all across the world. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="maroon">POALEI ZION</font></strong><font color="maroon"><font color="black"> (Heb. <em>Workers of Zion</em>) </font><strong><font color="black">,</font> </strong></font>Marxist-Zionist
 youth movement founded in Russia in 1901. Under the leadership of Ber 
Borochov, Poalei Zion merged Marxist thought with Zionist nationalism to
 form a radically new ideology which emphasized and taught Marxist 
collective principles without calling for the end of the national 
system. Poalei Zion grew rapidly, reaching Israel, Canada, and Israel 
within less than a decade of its founding, and even became an officially
 registered political party in Poland. Differences within the party led 
to a split between the right-wingers and left-wingers, and the party 
officially disbanded in 1950. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="Maroon">YOUNG JUDAEA</font></strong> (Heb. <em>Yehuda Ha'tzair</em>), the oldest Jewish youth movement in the United States, was
  founded in 1909 by the Zionist Organization of America. It promotes the
  Zionist idea, encourages Jewish youth in their spiritual and physical
  development, and fosters Jewish culture and identity. The movement,
  operating in conjunction with Hebrew schools, was the largest youth movement
  in American Jewry for many years. In World War I, some of its members joined
  the Jewish regiments. From 1924 on, Young Judaea developed a cooperative
  relationship with the Scouts organization in Palestine. In 1967, it accepted
  the patronage of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America.</p>
